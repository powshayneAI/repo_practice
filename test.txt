This is a test to ensure I've learned how to properly clone and send
repositories back into github.

If I am able to read this on github I will successfully understand how
to successfully push and pull repositories through a few different tests.

I will utilize the text file to take note of anything odd for future reference.

git status is used to check and ensure that everything is up to date in the
terminal.

git add . is used to add any adjustments made to any files within the repository
folder.

git commit -m "[enter message here]" is used to commit the edits in terminal,
preparing to push to github.

git push is used to push the repository back to github.

don't forget to save often.

git pull successfully worked. now to return the repository once more.
